Krysis .a new world

This build dated 4.2025, below i will tell some information.

You need to mount valve folder from a half-life installation, and it should work now.

Enjoy the earlu maps and stuff.

Good Maps to Play:

kr1a0_accurate

kr1a2a

kc0a1

Attenton:

Be careful with high fps, as the muzzleflashes time is frame dependant and it might not show as often as intended.

Try to keep it below 200 fps.

p.s. pass -krystal parameter to enginegl for a surprise weapon ;)
