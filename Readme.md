# KrYsis - A New World

This build dated 4.2025, below i will tell some information.

You need to copy the 'valve' folder from your Half-Life installation (preferably WON) here.
It works without it too but you'll be unable to see barely anything.

Enjoy And have fun.

Good Maps to Play:
kr1a0_accurate
kr1a2a
kc0a1

Note:
Be careful with high fps, as the muzzleflashes time is frame dependant and it might not show as often as intended.
Try to keep it below 200 fps.
